## Beginner

1. [ ] Write a program which finds the factorial of a number entered by the user. (check for all conditions).
2. [ ] Develop a program to convert currency X to currency Y and vice versa, and/or convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
3. [ ] Write a program that prints out a triangle from largest to smallest; user inputs the largest number. Eg:

```
*****
****
***
**
*
```

4. [ ] Write a program that prints out a triangle from smallest to largest; user inputs bottom number. Eg:

```
*
**
***
****
******
```

5. [ ] Print out a triangle from smallest to largest, skipping even rows. User inputs largest number, eg:

```
*
***
*****
*******
```

6. [ ] Given a string, determine how many of the characters are vowels and how many are consonants. Terminate the string when the input character encountered is non-alphabetic.
7. [ ] Calculate the frequency of letters in a given word/sentence.
8. [ ] Guessing game. ask the user to guess a number between 1 and a 100. If you guessed correctly, it will say you win. If you're too high or too low it will also let you know. 
9. [ ] Create a program which generates Fibonacci series til a number 'n', where 'n' is entered by the user. Eg if the user enters 10 then the output would be: `1 1 2 3 5 8`
10. [ ] Generate "secure" passwords with random characters and numbers, with a user input to limit length.
11. [ ] List all possible combinations of letters in a 4-letter word. Eg 'TEST' can be unscrambled as TEST, TETS, TSET, TSTE, TTSE, TTES, etc.
12. [ ] Make a program that allows the user to input either the radius, diameter, or area of the circle. The program should then calculate the other 2 based on the input.
13. [ ] Read a line of text and write it out backwards using a recursive function.
14. [ ] Write a program to simulate a simple calculator. It should accept two numbers from the user along with the required operation to be performed. Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are the basic operations that should be implemented. Feel free to implement other operations. Bonus points for splitting the calculation functions into a separate module.
15. [ ] Calculate the total amount of money given varying amounts of change (i.e. how much money is 7345 quarters and 4281 nickels).
16. [ ] Create a simple palindrome checker program. The program should allow the user to enter a string and check whether the given string is a palindrome or not. Only digits and alphabets should be considered while checking for palindromes - any other characters are to be ignored.
17. [ ] Write a program that allows you to input students' midterm, final and homework scores, and calculate a weighted score. Use the following weights: 20% midterm, 40% final, 40% median homework.

## Intermediate

18. [ ] Simple file encryption (using something simple like ROT13).
19. [ ] Write a program which will print all the pairs of prime numbers whose sum equals the number entered by the user. Eg 10 = 5 + 5, 7 + 3; 12 = 11 + 1, 5 + 7
20. [ ] Write a quiz which retrieves a question and answer from a file. Allow the user to take the quiz, count points total and show score.
21. [ ] Write a Wordle solver (Extra: Add a GUI).
22. [ ] Read XHTML, remove the tags, then print out the remaining text.
23. [ ] Write a program which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication of matrices. The dimensions of both the matrices would be specified by the user (dynamic memory allocation required). Use of structure or a class to define the matrix would be a good idea.
24. [ ] Write a program which will perform the job of moving the file from one location to another. The source and destination path will be entered by the user. Perform the required error checking and handle the exceptions accordingly.
25. [ ] Create a sophisticated linked list class. You should be able to insert and delete nodes anywhere in the list, and the linked list should be (doubly linked)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list]. 
26. [ ] Create a program that implements a database. The fields are hard-coded, and the data is saved in a binary file. Although this isn't really flexibility, you aren't relying on any external libraries or functions.
27. [ ] Create a command-line todo list. Users should be able to add, complete and delete items. Bonus: use a database (eg SQLite) to persist todo items between program runs.

## Expert

- [ ] Write a program which acts like a personal planner. A user can input an event, note things to-do on a certain date.
28. [ ] Make a Markov chain generator. Read text from a source, create a histogram and allow different prefix lengths. See [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2014.html#sec159) for info.
29. [ ] Noughts and crosses game.
30. [ ] Create a Youtube video downloader
31. [ ] Write an OS (https://os.phil-opp.com/)
