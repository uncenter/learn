## Beginner Projects (CLI)
- [ ] Write a program which finds the factorial of a number entered by the user.
- [ ] Develop a program to convert currency X to currency Y and vice versa, and/or convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- [ ] Given a string, determine how many of the characters are vowels and how many are consonants. Terminate the string when the input character encountered is non-alphabetic.
- [ ] Read a line of text and write it out backwards.
- [ ] Calculate the frequency of letters in a given word/sentence.
- [ ] Create a program which generates Fibonacci series, taking in a number 'n', where 'n' defines the upper limit of the sequence.
- [ ] Generate "secure" (random) passwords with random characters and numbers. Take in user input to determine string length.
- [ ] List all possible combinations of letters in any word. For example, 'TEST' can be unscrambled as TEST, TETS, TSET, TSTE, TTSE, TTES, etc.
- [ ] Make a program that allows the user to input either the radius, diameter, or area of the circle. The program should then calculate the other two based on the input.
- [ ] Write a program to simulate a simple calculator. It should accept two numbers from the user along with the required operation to be performed. Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are the basic operations that should be implemented. Feel free to implement other operations. Bonus points for splitting the calculation functions into a separate module.
- [ ] Calculate the total amount of money given varying amounts of change (i.e. what is the dollar equivalent of 7345 quarters and 4281 nickels).
- [ ] Create a simple palindrome checker program. The program should allow the user to enter a string and check whether the given string is a palindrome or not. Only digits and alphabetical characters should be considered while checking for palindromes - any other characters are to be ignored.
- [ ] Write a program that allows you to input students' midterm, final, and homework scores, and calculate a weighted score. Gather weights from user input.

## Intermediate Projects (still mostly CLI)
- [ ] Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle (https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?t=6715).
- [ ] Command line version of Minesweeper (https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?t=5236).
- [ ] Simple file encryption (using something simple like [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)).
- [ ] Create a more advanced calculator which can handle more than two numbers at a time. It should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. Parse an input string to determine the operation to be performed.
- [ ] [An *actual* password generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&t=4190s).
- [ ] Write a program which deals with everything prime numbers; check for prime numbers, prime factors, etc. You could even do something funky like display all the pairs of prime numbers whose sum equals the number entered by the user (10 = `5 + 5`, `7 + 3`; 12 = `11 + 1`, `5 + 7`).
- [ ] Write a quiz which retrieves a question and answer from a file. Allow the user to take the quiz, count points total and show score. Optionally, save the results to a file.
- [ ] Write a Wordle solver.
- [ ] Recreate Wordle using a [word list](https://github.com/uncenter/words/blob/main/nl-delimiter/wordle_answers.txt).
- [ ] Parse the body of an HTML file and scrape it for text. Return the results to a plaintext or Markdown file.
- [ ] Write a program which performs addition, subtraction, multiplication of matrices.
- [ ] Write a program which will perform the job of moving a file from one location to another. The source and destination path will be entered by the user. Perform the required error checking and handle the exceptions accordingly.

## Difficult Projects (Database, GUI, etc.)
- [ ] Create a program that implements a database. For example, you could create a database of students and their grades. The program should allow the user to add, delete, and modify records. The program should also allow the user to search for a specific record.
- [ ] Create a command-line todo list. Users should be able to add, complete and delete items. Bonus: use a database (eg SQLite) to persist todo items between program runs. 
- [ ] Manipulate a photo in Python (https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?t=7535). Bonus: make a command-line photo editor; take in a URL or file path, and allow the user to apply filters, crop, etc.
- [ ] Write a program which acts like a personal planner. A user can input an event, note things to-do on a certain date. Bonus: allow the user to search for events on a certain date. Also, use a database to persist events between program runs.
- [ ] Write a phone/address book program, with persistent data. The users should be able to add/delete/change the data.

## *More* Difficult Projects (Web, ML/AI, system, or complex interfaces)
- [ ] [Make a Markov chain generator](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?t=9109). Read text from a source and graph it.
- [ ] Create a Youtube video downloader.
- [ ] [Create an operating system](https://os.phil-opp.com/).
- [ ] Write a simple payroll program, that would include pay rates, and hours work for employees. Create employee and employer interfaces to interact.
- [ ] Write a card game (Blackjack, Solitaire). Bonus: Make a GUI for it!
- [ ] Create a chess game. Bonus: GUI!
- [ ] Make a webpage or application.
- [ ] Write a Twitter, Reddit, or Discord bot.
- [ ] [Create a binary search algorithm](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?t=4553).
- [ ] Create a Quine (a program that prints out its own source code).
- [ ] Write a custom text editor.
- [ ] Convert videos between format.
- [ ] Make a URL shortener service.

## GUI Projects
- [ ] Write a program to draw a rectangle, ellipse, square, circle, point and line based on user input.
- [ ] Create a paint program. It should be possible to switch between different tools (circle, rectangle, eraser etc) using pre-defined keybinds or a toolbar. It should be possible to change the colour of the tool. It should be possible to save the image to a file.
- [ ] Create a line plotter. Take user input for the line, and add functionality to edit the line (move, rotate, scale, etc).  It should be possible to save the image to a file.
- [ ] Recreate the classic brick break-out game (Arkanoid/Breakout).
- [ ] Recreate a basic snake game.
